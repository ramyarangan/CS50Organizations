Organizations


FIRST STEPS.

Let’s begin! Head over to http://hcs.harvard.edu/~cs50-groups/, the home page. The first thing you should see prominently on the
page is an empty calendar on the Events page, along with a toggle to view announcements to the left. As per
the blue alert, you should select some clubs to view upcoming events around campus. Through the second
dropdown, you can also choosing the privacy level of events you’d like to view. But regardless of what you
pick, you’ll only see events you’re actually authorized to see. So since you’re not logged in right now, you’ll
only see public events. Since our calendar is implemented through Google, you can export events to your
personal Google calendars or iCals.

Now look at the top of the site to see the navigation bar, which allows you to quickly get to pages that you
visit the most. The logo on the left side of the nav bar links you back to the home page. The next drop-down
you see allows you to view your organizations. It’s pretty uninteresting now that you’re not logged in, but for
now, just click on the all organizations page to get an idea of all the clubs currently on the site. Play around
with these tabs a bit. The highlighting and expanding is really cool! Note that all the club names you see here
are links to the appropriate club page, but we’ll get to those soon...

Scrolling through the “All Organizations” page to find the club you’re looking for may be a bit tedious. To
help you out, we’ve added a search bar, equipped with a spiffy auto-complete function. Try to search
something. You can search for clubs (by name), announcements (by title), or events (by title).
Now find your way to any club page. Here, conviently displayed are the events and announcements visible to
your privacy level for this club, as well as links for emailing club administrators or subscribing to email or text
notifications of announcements. Try some of these forms out--you’ll notice the live error-checking! Most of
our forms are equipped with such security checks.

LOG IN.

Okay, enough playing around without logging in. Let’s make an account. Click on the login button on the top
of the navigation bar, and then click to register. Once you’re done, if you check your email, you should see a
message confirming that your registration was successful.

Now you’re logged in! You can log out whenever you like by going into the dropdown at the top right of the
page, and if you ever forget your username or password, we have a recovery link from the login page. You
can also change your account settings from the top right drop down whenever you like.
Note that the navbar now has a globe tab. Here, alerts will pop up as your clubs make announcements, add
events, and so on. Your 10 most recent notifications will show on the tab, and they’ll be highlighted until you
click on the tab, which should reset your notifications count to 0.

Now, make your way back to any club’s page, and try signing up for a club. If it’s a closed club, as per the
alert, you’ll have to wait for admin to approve your request, but you can still subscribe to their emails and
notifications. If it’s an open club, you’ll automatically be a member, but the club admins can change your status
if they desire. If you ever sign up for a club that you’re having second thoughts about, or if you’re wishing you
weren’t subscribed to a club’s emails and text notifications, fear not! Head over to account settings (under the
user tab in the navbar) to modify your settings.

One last thing. Your navbar’s Organizations tab now links to your organizations’ pages for convenience, along
with other links to manage subscriptions and administrate your own clubs.

BEING A BOSS.

Following is fun, but bossing is better! (Alliteration.) Much of CS50 Organization’s functionality is available to
club administrators only, such as the ability to add events and manage member statuses.
Let’s try that out. Click on the appropriate link in the Organizations tab, and fill in the form. We’ll check that
we don’t have a duplicate organization. The club attributes will allow users to find your club more easily when
they’re searching for organizations to join.

Viewing your new club’s page, note that the toolbar in the center has expanded to show an admin palette.
These links let you make announcements for this organization, manage members’ membership levels, and edit
the group’s settings. If you ever forget which button is which, just hover over the links. You can also make an
event or announcement for any club you administrate via the Organizations tab. Try these functions out—
your calendar is lonely right now. </3

Since this club isn’t quite live, there aren’t real users to join your club. But don’t be sad. To make you feel
loved (and to help you view/test more of our features), we’ve created a few dummy test accounts under the
usernames jharvard, nextUser, and dummy, all with password crimsongroups. If that’s not enough, feel free to
create more accounts. (Just to test, of course.)

You can use these three accounts to join each others’ clubs, make announcements, add events, and subscribe
to different feeds. Notice the different visibilities of events for different privacy settings, and watch alerts pop
up on the Notifications feed as the people act. Subscribe to emails. Get text feeds. Edit membership statuses
if you’re an administrator. Have fun. Go forth and explore!

PARTING IS SUCH SWEET SORROW.

CS50 comes to an end, but we hope to extend our site with new features—such as allowing club admin to
email specific subscribers from their management page, giving club admin tools to edit and remove events and
announcements, allowing members to share their upcoming events on Facebook or like their favorite clubs.
When we’re ready, we hope to launch it on a public domain name and allow students to log in through their
HUIDs.

But till then, thank you so much for touring our site! (:

If you scroll down to the footer, you’ll see a “Contact us” link. We’d love to hear your feedback on the site.
Again, thanks! We hope you’ve enjoyed CS50 Organizations.
